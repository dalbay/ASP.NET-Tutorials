## SQL Data Source

- A **SqlDataSource** control provides the information an application needs to connect to a database and retrieve the data needed by the application. It can also be used to insert, update, and delete data.
- A SQL data source can be bound to another control, such as a drop down list or a DataList control. Then, the data that's retrieved by the data source is displayed in that control.
